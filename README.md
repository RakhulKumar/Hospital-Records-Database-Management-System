# Hospital-Records-Database-Management-System

In the traditional management system, we always see that to find out the patientâ€™s history, the user has to go through various registers. This results in a waste of time. The Hospital management system database design is used to manage hospital functions and events. It enables the admin to register a patient for the hospital and store their disease details in the database. Any of the staff members, doctor & admin is able to add, view, edit, update or delete data. The purpose of the Hospital Management System Database Design is to make a secure and easy way of storing patient information, doctors, Hospital Staff, Laboratory tests and Bill payment. The proposed system is more user-friendly, faster and requires a lower cost of maintenance when compared to the conventional file registers system.


There are 9 entities (tables) in this database. They are:\
		a. `Blog`\
		b. `Blog details`\
		c. `Doctors`\
		d. `Login`\
		e. `Patient Appointments`\
		f. `Pharmacy`\
		g. `Prescription`\
		h. `Services`\
		i. `Timings`
