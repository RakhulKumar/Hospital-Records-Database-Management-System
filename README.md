# Hospital-Records-Database-Management-System

In the traditional management system, we always see that to find out the patient’s history, the user has to go through various registers. This results in a waste of time. The Hospital management system database design is used to manage hospital functions and events. It enables the admin to register a patient for the hospital and store their disease details in the database. Any of the staff members, doctor & admin is able to add, view, edit, update or delete data. The purpose of the Hospital Management System Database Design is to make a secure and easy way of storing patient information, doctors, Hospital Staff, Laboratory tests and Bill payment. 

The proposed system is more user-friendly, faster and requires a lower cost of maintenance when compared to the conventional file registers system. For example, laboratory attendants and doctors can use this database system for the preparation of accurate and prompt reports. Various changes to information like patient details or immunization details of a child can be easily updated. Calculation of a patient’s bill based on various treatments can be made easier. With this system, it will become easy to manage all processes.


There are 9 entities (tables) in this database. They are:\
		a. `Blog`\
		b. `Blog details`\
		c. `Doctors`\
		d. `Login`\
		e. `Patient Appointments`\
		f. `Pharmacy`\
		g. `Prescription`\
		h. `Services`\
